I am a research engineer at LightSpeed Studios, Tencent where I build game AI with Reinforcement Learning and AI. I obtained my PhD degree at the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University</a>, where I work on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and reinforcement learning (RL). My PhD advisors are <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/">Bo An</a> and <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00219">Lana Obraztsova</a>. I received my bachelor degree in management and master degree in software engineering at South China University of Technology in China.

During my PhD career, I have been broadly interested in reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, human-like AI, human-ai coordination and their applications to real-world problems, such as creating human-like bots in video games. I am also interested in generative AI, foundation models and embodied AI. My research goal is to create a generalist agent that can act in the world and benefit human beings.
